## JIRA (FREE EDITION)

- [ ] Bot needs to be at the top of the roles list. Check for this on boot/commands that it matters for. Anything that calls roles or users needs to be caught.
- [ ] Code review
- [ ] Message handler
- [ ] Count to 100,000
- [ ] Merge tag/role/course list command into a service. They're literally all the same, copy/pasted.
- [ ] Serious, serious testing.
  - [ ] Nick tested and found some course creation bugs.
  - [ ] Most bugs found are related to cacheing -- pay attention to where caches are being reset.
- [ ] Add /set- and /get-realname. Let students privately set their realname so only faculty can access them.
- [ ] Add logging everywhere.
- [ ] Add quarter list command.
- [ ] /qotd command. Preload questions of the day and create threads daily out of them.
- [x] Enable Logging
  - [x] To database
  - [x] To Logging channel
- [x] Add "all" to permissions command
  - As in, add the ability to write "all" and apply the permissions change to all commands for a user or role. ie for an admin role.
- [x] Course requests
  - One-click create
- [x] Self-Roles
  - [x] Schema
  - [x] Commands
- [x] Tags
  - [x] Schema
  - [x] Commands
- [x] Remove course prefix/number/section in favor for strong validation and alias array in db.
  - Make sure this is the way to go first.
- [x] Add migration routine
  - Command that allows the guild owner to move to bluedaemon. This will allow you to create a quarter, then add entire categories of classes. Data would need to be validated beforehand ie courses created must match CSC300-123 format.
- [x] Cache all courses and quarters just like guild.
- [x] Reset pieces of cache instead of resetting the whole thing every time.
- [x] Allow multiple course owners
  - Not going to implement this one. Owners have permission to give granular permissions as needed -- TAs and tutors can be granted these permissions anytime without bot help.
