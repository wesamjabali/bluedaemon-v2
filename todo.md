- [ ] Remove course prefix/number/section in favor for strong validation and alias array in db.
  - Make sure this is the way to go first.
- [ ] Add migration routine
  - Command that allows the guild owner to move to bluedaemon. This will allow you to create a quarter, then add entire categories of classes. Data would need to be validated beforehand ie courses created must match CSC300-123 format.
- [x] Cache all courses and quarters just like guild.
- [x] Reset pieces of cache instead of resetting the whole thing every time.
- [x] Allow multiple course owners
  - Not going to implement this one. Owners have permission to give granular permissions as needed -- TAs and tutors can be granted these permissions anytime without bot help.
